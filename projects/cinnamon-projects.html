<h1>Cinnamon Projects</h1>

<p>Cinnamon is composed a lot of smaller interconnected projects:</p>

        <h3>Cinnamon</h3>
        <p>
            Cinnamon, forked from GNOME Shell, is the "shell" of Cinnamon. It provides the user interface such as
            panels, hot corners, menus etc. The ui is written in JavaScript, while its core libraries are written in C.

        <h3>Cinnamon Screensaver</h3>
        <p>
            Cinnamon Screensaver, forked from GNOME Screensaver, is the screen locker you see when you leave the session
            idle for the a long time. It currently supports loading xscreensaver hacks as well as webkit screensaver.
            You can also write your own Cinnamon Screensaver plugin without tying to either xscreensaver or webkit.

        <h3>Cinnamon Desktop</h3>
        <p>
            Cinnamon Desktop, fork of GNOME desktop, provides certain useful resources for Cinnamon. Most importantly,
            it contains the schemas for most Cinnamon components, eg. `org.cinnamon.desktop.screensaver`. It also has a
            small library that provides certain functions used in, say, Cinnamon Screensaver.

        <h3>Cinnamon Menus</h3>
        <p>Cinnamon Menus, fork of GNOME menus, contains the <code>libcinnamon-menu</code> library, the layout
            configuration files for the Cinnamon menu, as well as a simple menu editor.</p>
        <p>The <code>libcinnamon-menu</code> library implements the "Desktop Menu Specification" from freedesktop.org:

        <h3>Cinnamon Settings Daemon</h3>
        <p>Cinnamon Settings Daemon is a fork of GNOME Settings Daemon.</p>
        <p>It provides many session-wide services and functions that require a long-running process. Among the services
            implemented by cinnamon-settings-daemon are an XSettings manager, which provides theming, font and other
            settings to GTK+ applications, and a clipboard manager, which preserves clipboard contents when an
            application exits. Many user interface elements of cinnamon and cinnamon-settings rely on
            cinnamon-settings-daemon for their functionality.</p>
        <p>The internal architecture of cinnamon-settings-daemon consists of a number of plugins, which provide
            functionality such as printer notifications, software update monitoring, background changing, etc. For
            debugging purposes, these plugins can be individually disabled by changing the gsettings key
            `org.cinnamon.settings-daemon.plugins.plugin-name.active`, where `plugin-name` is the name of the plugin. To
            see a list of all plugins, use the command `gsettings list-children
            org.cinnamon.settings-daemon.plugins`.</p>
        <p>Cinnamon Settings Daemon takes the name `org.cinnamon.SettingsDaemon` on the session bus to ensure that only
            one instance is running. Some plugins export objects under this name to make their functionality available
            to other applications. The interfaces of these objects should generally be considered private and
            unstable.</p>
        <p>Cinnamon Settings Daemon is a required component of the Cinnamon desktop, i.e. it is listed in the
            RequiredComponents field of `/usr/share/cinnamon-session/sessions/cinnamon.session`. It is started in the
            initialization phase of the session, and cinnamon-session will restart it if it crashes.</p>

        <h3>Cinnamon Control Center</h3>
        <p>Cinnamon Control Center is a fork of GNOME Control Center. The official control center of Cinnamon in
            Cinnamon Settings, which is written in python and part of Cinnamon itself. However, some of the modules are
            still not yet ported to python, and we have to rely on the C modules, which are found here.</p>

        <h3>Cinnamon Session</h3>
        <p>This is responsible for starting the Cinnamon session. This is typically executed by the login manager
            (either mdm, xdm, or from your X startup scripts). It will load either your saved session, or it will
            provide a default session for the user as defined by the system administrator (or the default GNOME
            installation on your system).</p>

        <h3>CJS</h3>
        <p>
            Cjs, fork of Gjs, is the "interpreter" of Cinnamon's javascript code. It is not an actual interpreter - the
            interpretation is done by SpiderMonkey. Instead, the role of Cjs is to provide bindings to GNOME libraries
            through GObject Introspection.
